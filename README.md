# Roam Research Dark Theme

This is my go-to dark theme for [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com). It's a modified version of [adityadaniel](https://github.com/adityadaniel)'s **Roam Panic** theme â€” which is based on the [Bear](https://bear.app/) app Panic Mode theme.

## How to use
1. Create a new page called "_roam/css_".
2. Create a code block within the page and choose `CSS` in the drop-down menu.
3. Copy and paste the contents of [roam-bear-panic.css](https://github.com/pamelamaguigad/roam-dark-theme/blob/master/roam-bear-panic.css) in the code block.<br>---<br>
Alternatively, you can use the CSS `@import` rule to import the contents of the CSS file hosted in this repository.
```css
@import url('https://pamelamaguigad.github.io/roam-dark-theme/roam-bear-panic.css');
```

4. As an added option, you can nest the code block under a page link so you have the option to toggle the theme using the page filter.

## Contribution
The theme is receiving ongoing changes as I continue to optimise my [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) workflow. Feel free to make suggestions via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PamelaMaguigad), create a an issue, or fork this project for your own experimentation ðŸ§ª.
